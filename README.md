# Lightblue

A mostly from scratch implementation of general deep neural networks and autograd in C. The objective is to use this library to build reinforcement learning algorithms as a learning exercise.

Please note that this project is very much so a work in progress but feel free to reach out with any feedback, comments, or ideas on what I could build with this!

## Dependencies
After realizing that implementing a custom generalized linear algebra library may require a little too much time, I decided to use of [BLIS](https://github.com/flame/blis/tree/master). Please see their excellent [build system documentation](https://github.com/flame/blis/blob/master/docs/BuildSystem.md) for details on how to install this library and to ensure that the Makefile for this project is correct.
